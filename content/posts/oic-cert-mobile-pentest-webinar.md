## Overview

I was invited to speak at the **OIC-CERT webinar series** on advanced mobile app penetration testing. This presentation takes a unique approach by stepping back from highly technical details and focusing on a **holistic view of mobile penetration testing**.

The goal is to help people who are new to mobile security but need to understand, plan, or manage a mobile penetration testing project. Whether you're a project manager, security officer, or technical lead, this presentation provides practical insights into:

- **What** mobile penetration testing involves
- **Why** it matters for your application security
- **How** to approach a mobile pentest project effectively
- **Key considerations** across the testing lifecycle

## About This Presentation

**Presented:** August 2025 (OIC-CERT Webinar Series)

**Audience Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (non-technical to technical)

**Format:** Presentation slides designed for general audiences with diverse backgrounds

This is **not a deep technical dive** into exploitation techniques or code-level vulnerabilities. Instead, it provides a **roadmap for understanding mobile application security testing** from a project and strategic perspective.
