Recently, I had the opportunity to conduct a penetration test on a React Native Android application that implemented end-to-end encryption for all HTTP communications. What initially seemed like a roadblock turned into an fascinating journey through reverse engineering, AI-assisted analysis, and custom tooling development. Here's how I broke through the encryption barrier to uncover critical security vulnerabilities.

## The Challenge: Encrypted Everything

The target application encrypted all HTTP request and response data, making traditional web application testing approaches ineffective. While this might seem like good security practice, my initial analysis revealed some concerning patterns:

- **Static Behavior**: The app could decrypt messages created days earlier
- **Cross-User Decryption**: Messages from different users were successfully decrypted by the same app instance

These observations suggested the encryption implementation might have fundamental flaws, potentially using static keys rather than proper key exchange mechanisms.

## The Reverse Engineering Journey

### Step 1: Decompiling the Android Bundle

Since this was a React Native application, the core logic resided in JavaScript bundled within the APK. I used [hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec), an excellent tool for decompiling Android bundles back into readable (though obfuscated) JavaScript.

```bash
# Decompiling the React Native bundle
hermes-dec android.bundle > decompiled.js
```

The decompilation was straightforward, yielding a large JavaScript file containing the app's business logic.

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition

After analyzing the decompiled code, I identified clear patterns indicating where encryption and decryption operations occurred. The code structure revealed:

- **AES encryption usage** - Multiple references to AES cryptographic functions
- **Symmetric key operations** - Consistent patterns suggesting the same key for encrypt/decrypt
- **Encoded key material** - The actual encryption key was not plainly visible but appeared to be encoded

### Step 3: AI-Powered Analysis

Rather than spending hours manually tracing through obfuscated JavaScript, I decided to leverage AI assistance. I provided Claude with:

- Sample encrypted requests and responses
- The suspected encryption/decryption functions from the decompiled code
- My hypothesis about the static key usage

Within approximately 5 minutes, Claude successfully identified:
- The **encryption key**
- The **salt values**
- The complete **encryption parameters**

## Building the Testing Infrastructure

### Creating the Decryption Engine

Once I had the cryptographic parameters, I asked Claude to create a Python script to validate the findings:

```python
# Example structure of the decryption script
import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad, pad

def decrypt_payload(encrypted_data, key, salt):
    # Implementation details...
    pass

def encrypt_payload(plaintext, key, salt):
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

The script successfully decrypted sample traffic, confirming our analysis was correct.

### Scaling with a Web API

To make the encryption/decryption functionality more accessible, I converted the Python script into a simple web API:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/decrypt', methods=['POST'])
def decrypt_endpoint():
    # Decrypt incoming data
    pass

@app.route('/encrypt', methods=['POST'])
def encrypt_endpoint():
    # Encrypt outgoing data
    pass
```

### Automating with Burp Suite

The final piece was creating a Burp Suite extension to automate the entire process. The extension provides:

- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes encrypted traffic patterns
- **History Integration**: Adds a new tab showing decrypted requests/responses
- **Repeater Support**: Allows payload modification with automatic re-encryption
- **API Integration**: Calls our web API for cryptographic operations

I chose the API approach because Jython (Burp's Python environment) has limitations with certain cryptographic libraries I needed.

## The Results: Hidden Vulnerabilities Revealed

With the encryption barrier removed, I could finally conduct a proper penetration test. The decrypted traffic revealed several critical issues:

### Broken Access Control
Multiple endpoints suffered from **horizontal privilege escalation** vulnerabilities, allowing users to access and modify data belonging to other users. These issues were completely hidden behind the encryption layer and would have been impossible to discover through traditional black-box testing.

### Additional Findings
- Insufficient input validation on supposedly "protected" parameters
- Logic flaws in user authorization checks
- Sensitive data exposure in API responses

## Key Takeaways

This engagement highlighted several important lessons:

### For Security Professionals
1. **Don't assume encryption equals security** - Implementation flaws can render even strong encryption useless
2. **Static keys are a critical vulnerability** - Proper key management is essential
3. **Modern tools make reverse engineering more accessible** - Tools like hermes-dec significantly lower the barrier to mobile app analysis
4. **AI can accelerate analysis** - When used appropriately, AI can quickly identify patterns in complex code

### For Developers
1. **Implement proper key exchange mechanisms** - Never use static keys for production encryption
2. **Consider the entire security model** - Encryption should complement, not replace, proper access controls
3. **Test your encryption implementation** - Ensure keys are properly rotated and managed
4. **Don't rely on client-side encryption alone** - Server-side validation remains critical

## Conclusion

This penetration test demonstrated that sophisticated-looking security measures can sometimes hide fundamental flaws. The combination of reverse engineering, AI-assisted analysis, and custom tooling development allowed me to uncover critical vulnerabilities that would have otherwise remained hidden.

The experience reinforced the importance of comprehensive security testing that goes beyond surface-level analysis, especially when dealing with applications that implement custom encryption schemes.
